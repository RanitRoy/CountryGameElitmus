# CountryGameElitmus
This is a fun to play and learning game.
Here, the user needs to guess the different state names of the country (currently USA).
If he/she is correct then the state's name will be placed on the correct position on the country's map.
Likewise he/she has to guess all the states name correctly.
This game can be used to teach children about different states name and their geographical positions.
