# CountryGameElitmus
This is a fun to play and learning game.
Here, the user needs to guess the different state names of the country (currently USA) and if he can guess the name correctly.
If he/she is correct then the state's name will be placed on the correct position on the country's map.
Likewise he/she has to guess all the states name correctly.
This game can be used to teach children about different states name and their geographical positions.
